                        <h2>The Hazards of Moviegoing</h2>
                    </header>

                    <p>
                        First of all, getting to the movie can take a lot of time. I have a thirty five-minute drive down a congested highway. Then, with a popular film, I usually have to wait in a long line at the ticket booth. Another problem is that the theater itself is seldom a pleasant place to be. A musty smell suggests that there has been no fresh air in the theater since it was built. Half the seats seem to be failing apart. And the floor often has a sticky coating that gets on your shoes. The worst problem of all is some of the other moviegoers. Kids run up and down the aisle. Teenagers laugh and shout at the screen. People of all ages loudly drop soda cups and popcorn tubs, cough and burp, and elbow you out of the armrest on either side of your seat.
                        <br>
                        All in all, I would rather stay home and wait for the latest movie hits to appear on TV in the safety and comfort of my own living room.
